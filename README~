A template for a Sinatra app that gets Authlogic working for authentication.

To use it, make sure that you have the required dependancies:

  gem install sinatra haml authlogic active_record

Then fork this project, or clone it: 

  git clone git://github.com/ehsanul/Sinatra-Authlogic-Template.git

If you have sqlite3 installed, the app should work right out of the box. Run it with:

  ruby sin-auth-template.rb
  
If you want to use a different database, just edit the db/config.yml file and set the desired adapter
